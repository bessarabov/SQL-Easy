For now I have 3 more things that I think should be implemented here:

 * Need to make check if the db connectin is still exists and reconnect if needed.

 * Now there are subs that return row and col info in an array.
   I whant to make subs that return that info in a hash.

 * I think it is a good idea to make aliases for subs for powerusers.
   Instead of writing $se->return_one(...) it it easier (but less clear) to write $se->ro(...)
