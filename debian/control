Description: extremely easy access to sql data
 On cpan there are a lot of ORMs. The problem is that sometimes ORM are too
 complex. You don't need ORM in a simple script with couple requests. ORM is
 sometimes difficult to use, you need to learn its syntax. From the other hand
 you already knows SQL language.
 .
 SQL::Easy give you easy access to data stored in databases using well known
 SQL language.
